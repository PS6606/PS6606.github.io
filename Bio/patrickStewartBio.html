<h1>About Patrick Stewart</h1>
<p>
I always had a love for coding and video games. My dream was to make my own video game so I could enjoy the genres I like. So, I enrolled myself into the <i>Software Development</i> program to take that first step towards my dream. I have high hope for this first year I hope to learn a lot and grow my knowledge in Coding and programming.
</p>
<p>
For these <b>next two years</b> I will focus hard on my studies, so I will make my dream a reality. I am glad that I chose <i>The College of Western Idaho</i> to give me the support I need to be successful.
